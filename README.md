# MI_correlation-based-filtering-algorithm
This package helps with dimensional reduction (feature selection) in a dataset with highly correlated features to improve the classification performance and decrease the run time. This package requires X_train, y_train, linear correlation and the mutual information (MI) threshold as inputs, and returns selected features list and the new dataset.
